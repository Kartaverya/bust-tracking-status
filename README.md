# College Bus Arrival Tracker

## Overview
A project designed to automate the process of recording bus arrivals at college using image recognition and backend logging. The goal is to eliminate manual noting by the security guard and create a digital system for real-time tracking. The project is currently on hold but planned for continuation and improvement.

## STAR Approach

**Situation:**  
In college, security personnel manually record which bus arrives and at what time by checking the bus number pasted on the windshield and noting it down on paper â€” a repetitive and error-prone process.

**Task:**  
To remove this tedious manual process by building a simple, automated solution that detects the bus number from an image and logs it with a timestamp.

**Action:**  
- Initiated development of a **Python Flask web app** as the backend.  
- Integrated **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** to detect bus numbers from captured images.  
- Planned a feature to **automatically update arrival logs** with timestamps.  
- Created an interface to **view bus arrivals in real time**.  
- The initial phase focused on OCR accuracy and backend design before pausing development.

**Result:**  
- Simplified the concept of bus tracking and reduced manual effort.  
- Demonstrated the feasibility of OCR-based automation in campus systems.  
- The project is **temporarily halted**, with plans to resume and complete the full web-based system with improved OCR, database integration, and UI.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Flask  
- Tesseract OCR / OpenCV  
- HTML, CSS (basic frontend)  
- SQLite / JSON (for record storage)
